# Welcome to Edge Dawn Toolbox

Here you will find the code for an open-source webtool to use with the board game Edge Dawnfall from Awaken Realms. This is a community driven project (Currently run by me Todilo) but anyone can contribute. If you just want to use the tool itself to create decks and share decks:

If you feel something is missing head over to the issue tracker and report/request feature. Found a bug, just write a bug report. Do you love the game and also have some web know-how and some spare time, just write in the issue tracker and request to add a feature. If the feature is approved write some code, do a pull request and feel good about yourself!

## How do I run it?

So far no back-end has implemented (and it will most likely stay that way for convenience), which makes everything run with just a single command. Clone the repo and run:

### `yarn start`

Make sure to run it in production mode as well

### `yarn build`
